    "\n",
    "Through this assignment you will gain experience working on a real-world dataset (as opposed to a \"toy\" dataset) that is used for research on urban sound classification. Your goal will be to train and evaluate a multi-class classifier using MFCC features. You may use the ```Sound_classifier``` notebook to guide your work. You may also find it helpful to read through the other example notebooks in this repository before starting work on this assignment.\n",

    "\n",
    "The *entire* assignment must be completed a in single, runnable (i.e. functional) iPython notebook. If you use code from the example notebooks, incorporate it into your assignment notebook and execute it there. Tasks should be completed in the order they appear, and answers to questions should be written in Markdown cells. Please include a title header for each task (and subtask) so that it is clear which task the code/text belongs to. For example, the answer to Task 1 would look like this:\n",

It is *imperative* that your notebook includes the output of each cell (if the cell has any output such as results, print commands or plots). **Notebooks without cell output will not be evaluated and graded 0 automatically**."
